### Source code for IJCNN 2018 classifier for Human Activity Recognition ###

The code here is the code that was used for the submitted paper "Human activity recognition from skeleton poses", and it is a generic hierarchical classifier that is basically wrapping other methods. 

This code is for conference only - in case an attempt to replicate it fails, it is always good to be able to reference the original source code and see how the author implemented such functions. 

If only the matlab GWR implementation is desired, we recommend using the implementation [here](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/57798-gwr-and-gng-classifier) that also packages the GNG implementation from [I. Konsoulas](http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/43665-unsupervised-learning-with-growing-neural-gas--gng--neural-network) for comparison. 

The presented is under development and new its structure is unnecessarily complex and many functions require clean-ups. As I am busy with other things, this may take a while, but if you want to help please contact me at frederico dot klein at plymouth dot ac dot uk.
